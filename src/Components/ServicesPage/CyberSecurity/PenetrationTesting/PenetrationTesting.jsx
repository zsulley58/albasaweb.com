        <h2>What is Penetration Testing?</h2>
        <p>
          In an era where cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated,
          safeguarding your digital assets is more crucial than ever.
          Penetration testing, or "pen testing," is a proactive cybersecurity
          practice where experts simulate cyber attacks on your systems,
          networks, or applications. The goal is to identify and address
          vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. By
          uncovering these weaknesses, you not only strengthen your defenses but
          also ensure compliance with industry regulations and protect sensitive
          data.
